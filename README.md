# Example Code

This repository will contain code examples for the projects covered described in the new [RAREblog](https://rareblog.substack.com).

The code is MIT licensed.

The first project plots the applied voltage and current for an LED. Details are in the `led_plot` directory.

The second project will contain more general code for creating simple plots on the Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico 2.

The Display interface borrows heavily from Pimoroni's [Micropyhon PicoGraphics Library](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/tree/main/micropython/modules/picographics), so it should be easy to use this package with products like the Pimoroni Pico Explorer, mono OLED, GFX pack and friends.
